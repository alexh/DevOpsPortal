# DevOpsPortal
An inward facing web application that allows development teams to interface with the DevOps team.
Built around the Microsoft stack, Octopus Deploy, and Jenkins.io.

This was my Summer 2016 Internship Project at VinSolutions that I completed while working on the DevOps team.

In order to build and run the application, connection strings need to be added to the web.config file that connect to either SQL databases
with the proper schema.

Soon I will be adding live demos of certain pages to show off the project without requiring building the full project.
